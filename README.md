# A Tour Across The United States

## Project of a travel agency simulation for the United States using *Grafo*, with the purpose of calculating the best route from a given city in less than 1 minute.

### Project description
* In this project a travel agency wants to help its clients get to know the United States. Customers will fly to one of the attached map cities in this repository. From there, they will rent a car to know all the cities on the map and in the end, they must return to the city of departure, return the rental car and return to Brazil. The goal of the project is to minimize the distance, passing through all cities of the map with the shortest path and program should execute and return the path in less than a minute. 
* Solving this problem can be applied to a number of other logistics issues, such as delivering products to multiple customers, leaving and returning to the distribution company, at the shortest distance, time or cost.
